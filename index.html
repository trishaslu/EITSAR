                    </a>

                    <p>Nestled about 250 kilometers to the north of Manila is the city known for being the
                        cool getaway from the hot Philippine temperatures. Baguio City is home to towering
                        pine trees and graceful hillocks, painting a picturesque landscape that captivates
                        the senses. Most importantly, the colorful town is also home to peaceful, hardworking,
                        and industrious people from all over the country.
                        <br><br>
                        Speaking of its citizens, the people of Baguio look up to their leaders who prioritize
                        good governance. The City Government continuously ensures that they are providing the
                        highest quality of services to their citizens through transparency, accountability,
                        and ethics. Therefore, it is no surprise that the citizens of Baguio are willing to
                        work for the city government.

                    <h3 id="reason-content" class="main-titles">Why Do People Want to Work in Baguio City?</h3>

                    <p>There are numerous reasons why people from different regions choose to work in the city
                        of Pines, with the climate being the most common. Aside from the cool temperatures,
                        collective Indeed reviews expressed that the overall culture found in the city is
                        what makes it worth it to work in Baguio. In fact, there have been numerous reviews
                        that commented on the positive behaviors observed among their colleagues. This is
                        important because having a favorable workplace will help boost motivation and
                        involvement. As a result, this will increase job satisfaction and employee retention.
                        <br><br>
                        Another notable factor that has compelled people to work in the city is the relatively
                        low cost of living. Travel Tables reported that Baguio provides a more affordable
                        living cost in comparison to major Philippine cities. This is one of the top reasons
                        why the city attracts students and retirees.

                    <h3 class="subtitle"><b><u>Benefits of Working in Baguio City</u></b></h3>
                    <p>Being a government employee, in general, offers a lot of benefits compared to those
                        employed by private establishments. According to
                        <a href="https://www.jobstreet.com.ph/career-advice/article/whats-stopping-you-from-pursuing-a-government-job" target="_blank" class="links"><b>Jobstreet</b></a>,
                        there is more stability in government jobs, considering employees will generally
                        not be affected by changes in the economy. Not only that, but the government
                        assures their employees health insurance, vacation leaves, and even housing programs.
                        <br><br>

                        In order to provide us with a deeper understanding of human resource management
                        in Baguio City, we conducted an interview with Atty. Laban, who serves as the
                        department head of the City Human Resource Management Office. According to the
                        <a href="https://new.baguio.gov.ph/city-human-resource-management-office/about" target="_blank" class="links"><b>City Government of Baguio's official website</b></a>,
                        this office is responsible for planning, developing, and implementing a
                        comprehensive and balanced City Human Resource development program.
                        Furthermore, one of the responsibilities of the office includes employee
                        screening, employee benefits, compensation, and talent management.
                        <br><br>
                        When asked about the benefits of working in the public sector, Atty Laban
                        answered, "First is the security of tenure." According to the
                        <a href="https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/featured/rights-of-employees/#:~:text=Security%20of%20tenure&text=No%20employee%20can%20be%20dismissed,are%20not%20the%20employee's%20fault." target="_blank" class="links"><b>Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines</b></a>,
                        this is when an employee cannot be terminated from their job unless there is
                        a valid and approved reason, and this can only occur following the appropriate
                        procedural steps.
                        <br><br>
                        "Once you are in government, your job is secured. Unlike in the private sector,
                        that when the private sector is not doing well, more or less, they can fire their
                        employees," Atty Laban continued. He also mentioned that government employees
                        receive higher pay compared to the private sector. Besides this, retirement is
                        also another benefit public sector employees receive. "If you are working in
                        government, then you are assured of pension [...] as long as you have worked for
                        at least 15 years."
                        <br><br>
                        Overall, the climate, relatively low cost of living, job security, certainty of
                        retirement, and comparatively higher pay make working for the City of Baguio
                        appealing to many.

                    <p>One way to assess whether an area holds good job opportunities is by looking
                        at the job market. In general, a lower unemployment rate often signifies a
                        healthier job market. According to 
                        <a href="https://www.sunstar.com.ph/article/1963575/manila/local-news/ph-unemployment-rate-drops-to-45-in-april-2023" target="_blank" class="links"><b>SunStar</b></a>,
                        there has been a positive change in terms of the unemployment rate across
                        the country as of April 2023. Their statistics show a percentage of 4.5%
                        unemployed Filipinos, which can be considered a substantial improvement
                        compared to last year&apos;s percentage of 5.7%.
                        <br><br>
                        Furthermore, the
                        <a href="https://pia.gov.ph/news/2023/06/09/dole-car-partners-invite-jobseekers-to-kalayaan-jobs-fair-in-baguio-city" target="_blank" class="links"><b>Philippine Information Agency</b></a>
                        reported that the
                        unemployment rate in the Cordillera Administrative region is even lower
                        than the national average of 4.8%. As of January 2023, the region&apos;s
                        unemployment rate stands at 3.3%. 
                        <br><br>
                        Looking at those figures, one can assume that the pursuit of employment
                        within the city of Pines might pose a lesser challenge in comparison to
                        other regions.

                    <p>When asked about job opportunities in Baguio City, Atty Laban mentioned that
                        there are numerous job opportunities in both the private and public sectors.
                        In fact, during the time of the interview, he mentioned that there was an
                        ongoing job fair being conducted in the Convention Center. Furthermore,
                        he stated, "Job fairs can happen at least twice a year — one is during May
                        1, Labor Day, and the other is when there are activities, like Baguio Day."
                        <br><br>
                        At the time of the interview, there was an ongoing 2023 World Café of
                        Opportunities cum National Tech-Voc Day. The event was being held by
                        the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) in
                        collaboration with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE). The post
                        uploaded by the

                        <br><br>
                        Furthermore, in the most recent Labor Day job and business fair, the
                        <a href="https://car.dole.gov.ph/news/baguio-labor-day-fair-to-offer-16k-jobs/" target="_blank" class="links"><b>Department of Labor and Employment</b></a>
                        reported a total of 15,784 job openings for local and overseas employment.
                        Some of the jobs being offered in this event include sales associates,
                        food and beverage staff, bookkeepers, and more.
                        <br><br>
                        With the government's efforts, it can be concluded that the citizens of Baguio
                        are given many opportunities to work in both the public and private sectors.
                        Aside from job fairs, there are also other available resources to check the
                        vacancies in the city government. One popular medium for this purpose is the
                        various online employment marketplaces, such as JobStreet, Indeed, and Jora.

                    <p>Among the tasks undertaken by the human resource department include making
                        job postings, reviewing applicants, and scheduling interviews. Moreover,
                        they take actions and steps to help the city find and secure the most

                        According to Atty Laban, the city government is looking for people with
                        experience and the right education. “We are looking for those who have
                        the potential to be good workers,” he adds. Although experience is one of
                        the biggest factors when hiring for the city of Baguio, Atty Laban expressed
                        that they remain open to hiring fresh graduates. “Of course [...] many fresh
                        graduates are in the office.” He says.

                    <p>A lot of factors affect the demand for job positions. This includes changes
                        in demographics, government initiatives, global events, and even industry trends.
                        <br><br>
                        “As far as the city government is concerned right now, the most in-demand jobs
                        are IT-related,” stated Atty Laban. He explained, “... because of systems and
                        because of our engagement with the internet.” He also stated that this demand
                        in the city government has only been observed in recent years. Accordingly,
                        “Well, of course, ten years ago is different because we [were] not so reliant
                        on technology. Although we are still looking for development of systems at the
                        time. But right now, the use of technology is full-blown; that&apos;s why IT
                        courses are in demand.”
                        <br><br>
                        <img src="Images/Homepage/Job1.png" alt="" id="baguio-city">
                        On the contrary, Atty Laban says that jobs related to general courses are not
                        as well sought after compared to IT-related jobs. “The government, just like
                        in the private sector, is now preferring skill-related [jobs]. Again, this is
                        driven by technology.”
                        <br><br>
                        Furthermore, some of the potential IT-related careers you can find within the
                        government include technical support representatives, IT security analysts, IT
                        project engineers, and more.
                        <br><br>
